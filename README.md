## History
CARDIAC (CARDboard Illustrative Aid to Computation) was a learning aid developed by David Hagelbarger and Saul Fingerman for
Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1968 to teach high school students how computers work. The kit consisted of an instruction
manual and a die-cut cardboard computer.

That computer operated by means of pencil and sliding cards. Any arithmetic was done in the head of the person operating the
computer. It operated in base 10 and had 100 memory cells which could hold numbers from 0 to 999. 
It has an instruction set of 10 instructions which allowed CARDIAC to add, subtract, test, shift, input, output and jump.

## Now
This Cardiac uses the same instruction set as the original but it handles all operations itself.
